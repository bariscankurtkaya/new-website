I am one of the two Hugging Face Ambassadors and Microsoft Ambassador in Turkey, my overarching objective involves two main areas of focus. The first is to develop computer vision solutions through the use of smart machine learning systems that can learn like humans with minimal or no supervision. The second is to promote greater transparency of these “black-box” systems. To achieve this, I plan to concentrate on the area of self-supervised and/or unsupervised learning and work towards shifting and advancing our understanding of artificial intelligence.
