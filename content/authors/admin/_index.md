I am a deep learning researcher ambitious to explore the power of generative deep learning models in artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in generative models, as well as 2D and 3D computer vision. Currently, I am pursuing graduate studies at Koc with a focus on video editing using diffusion models. I also serve as one of the two ambassadors of Hugging Face and Microsoft in Turkey. Additionally, I am a professional athlete and firmly believe in the collective strength of teamwork. This ethos deeply influences my approach to research and collaboration, and I am actively seeking opportunities to work in interdisciplinary teams.
